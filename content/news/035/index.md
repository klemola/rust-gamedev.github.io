Welcome to the 35th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### vetovoima

_vetovoima gravity manipulation_

[vetovoima][vetovoima_itch] by [@MatiasKlemola][vetovoima_twitter] is an arcade game
where you control gravity!

The world is a hollow circle with a star in the center. You're the Yellow
Block and your goal is to navigate through shifting debris to the Tall Blue
Block before the time runs out. The challenge is to survive the chaos that
ensues from changes to gravity.

vetovoima is built with the Bevy engine using Rapier for physics and Lyon for
rendering (via Bevy plugins).

[The alpha 1 build was recently released.](https://twitter.com/MatiasKlemola/status/1541338040521707521)
